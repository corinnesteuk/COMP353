Database Programming Class

COMP353 Database Programming (Loyola University Chicago)
This course introduces relational and objects databases to support database creation and application development. The use of commercial database products will give a practical orientation. I learned SQL, database design, and application development using the latest software tools. I also learned techniques for web-based data retrieval and manipulation.
